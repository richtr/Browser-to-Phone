The Desktop to Phone project consists of multiple browser plugins, an Android application and an AppEngine server that enables users to send links, maps, youtube videos, phone numbers and clipboard text between their desktop browser and their phone.

This project is originally branched from the 'Chrome to Phone' project (http://code.google.com/p/chrometophone). The reasons for branching this project are:

- Service agnostic Browser-to-Phone and Phone-to-Browser push
- Add support for additional phones (e.g. iPhone/iPad)
